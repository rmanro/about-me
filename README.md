# Pair programing
For this project Mario was the driver while Ryan was the navigator. Our purpose was to to fork a project from one another in order to add functions, update the README file with descriptions of the changes, and then Ryan is to pull the branch to merge into his master branch. 

We simply placed all Ryan's questions into a function.
